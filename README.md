# Tic Tac Toe - v1.0

A fun and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a twist â€” each player can only have **3 moves on the board at a time**! âœ¨

## Game Logic
- Two players: `X` and `O`
- Players take turns clicking on cells to mark their moves.
- Each player can have **only 3 active moves** on the board.
- When a player makes a 4th move, their **oldest move disappears**.
- The first to align 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- A confetti animation celebrates the winner! ðŸŽ‰
